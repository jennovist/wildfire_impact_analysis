# wildfire_impact_analysis
A remote sensing project using Google Earth Engine to analyze damage from one California wildfire in 2021. 

This was a final project from DePaul University GEO 243 Remote Sensing. For this project, the goal was to visualize the damage created by one specific wildfire in California. Remote sensing, or the use of satellite imagery to create raster data, has the ability to visualize greater areas do widespread analysis about everything from land use, vegetation, altitude, and more. As written in the write up, there are many efforts to use satellite imagery to both assess damage from wildfires and also learn more about the ways wildfires interact with the landscape.

In this repository, you'll find the final write up about project, including full methods, results, and final images generated. Regretfully, I don't have access the the data at this time and cannot retrieve the time lapse gif. I have included copies of my JavaScript code used to create the final visualizations and the time lapse.
